			<p>An alpaca (Vicugna pacos) is a domesticated species of South American camelid. It resembles a small llama in appearance.Alpacas are considerably smaller than llamas, and unlike llamas, they were not bred to be beasts of burden, but were bred specifically for their fiber. Alpaca fiber is used for making knitted and woven items, similar to wool. An adult alpaca generally is between 81–99 centimetres in height at the shoulders. They usually weigh 48–84 kilograms.</p>
